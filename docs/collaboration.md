# Collaboration Guidelines

Collaboration requires adaptability, trust, and continuous alignment among team members.

This documentation project started as a simple collection of notes about collaborative workflows. Over time, it evolved into a controlled environment for practicing real version control techniques.


The most important aspect of collaboration is communication. Comments in pull requests, documentation updates, and cleardescriptions of changes all help maintain a shared understanding of the project.
